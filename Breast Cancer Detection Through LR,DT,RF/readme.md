# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The implementation utilizes popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn (SKLearn), pandas, numpy, and seaborn.

## Dataset
The project employs a well-known dataset called the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. These features include various measurements related to the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images. The dataset consists of a total of 569 instances, classified into two classes: malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous).

## Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented for breast cancer detection:

1. **Logistic Regression:** A widely-used classification algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.

2. **Decision Tree:** A tree-based model that partitions the data based on different features to create a hierarchical decision structure, resulting in a predictive model.

3. **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to achieve a more accurate and robust classifier.

## Usage
To run this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- scikit-learn (SKLearn)
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn

After setting up the environment, you can clone the repository and execute the main script. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The results will be displayed, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms for breast cancer detection using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. By comparing the performance of these algorithms, it provides insights into their effectiveness in diagnosing breast cancer. The utilization of libraries such as SKLearn, pandas, numpy, and seaborn simplifies the implementation and visualization aspects, enabling efficient analysis of the dataset.
